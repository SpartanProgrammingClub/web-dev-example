    <div class="def-html center">
      <h2>HTML</h2>

      <p>
        This is basic HTML. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. This is
        how webpages are formed on their most basic level. HTML allows us to
        categorize content, which we can later customize. Currently, this page
        has no CSS. What you are seeing is pure HTML.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="def-css center">
      <h2>CSS</h2>

      <p>
        CSS stands for cascading style sheets. CSS adds style to your
        webpageâ€”colour, position, layouts, and basically everything else.

<!--       Creates a button with the unique name "toggle-css". The name makes it easy to customize/style -->
      <button id="toggle-css" type="button">Toggle CSS</button>
    </div>

    <div class="def-js center">
      <h2>Javascript</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike HTML and CSS, javascript is a real programming language. It is
        not related to Java. Javascipt, or JS, is used to add logic to webpages.
        This could be actions performed when clicking a button, or to change the
        page on the fly. The button in the CSS section is made using javascript,
        the code can be seen in the <strong>toggle-css.js</strong> 
        file.
      </p>
<!--       Creates a button with the unique name "js-exmaple". The name makes it easy to customize/style -->
      <button id="js-exmaple" type="button">Click Me!</button>
    </div>

<!--     This div is part of the hidden class. we use javascript to hide anything part of this class! -->
    <div class="magic-div hidden center">
      <h2>Magic!!</h2>
      <p>
        This was originally invisible, but I used javascript to interact with my
        CSS and HTML
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="def-django hidden center">
      <h2>Django - Backend</h2>
      <p>
        Django is a python framework that we will be using to implement basic
        back end features. Primarily, this will look like storing user data.
